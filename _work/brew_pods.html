    <h1>Case Study</h1>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge  was to create an online store for a physical product  using a Design system for both desktop and mobile versions.</p>
    <p>I chose to design an online store for a brand of coffee beans called “Brew Pods”.</p>

    <h2>Work Process</h2>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>Brew Pods is a coffee beans online shop where people can buy  3 different types of coffee beans individually or by subscription.
    </p>
    <p>The interface was designed according to the values of the brand: a classic but modern store with a high-quality product.</p>
