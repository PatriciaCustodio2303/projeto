    <h1>Case Study</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>belasartes.ulisboa.pt is the institutional website of the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon (FBAUL).</p>
    <p>This project aims to develop proposals to improve the experience of its users. To this end, we decided to focus on the experience of international participating users of the Erasmus + program who have chosen FBAUL as a host institution.</p>

    <h2>Work Process</h2>

    <h2>FBAUL Website</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Most menu pages do not have translated content in English;</li>
        <li>Relevant content is difficult to find and is only available in PDF;</li>
        <li>Some pages are not linked and therefore cannot be accessed;</li>
        <li>There is no information in English on the contents of each curricular unit, or on spaces of the faculty;</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>To better understand the needs and frustrations of these students, the team conducted interviews and surveys with students who participated in the ERASMUS program at FBAUL and with the Erasmus program coordinator of the faculty.</p>
    <p>The insights were then divided into 5 categories:</p>

    <h2>Persona</h2>

    <h2>Customer Journey Map</h2>
    <p>The map follows the persona's journey from the moment they make the decision to apply for the ERASMUS program until the end of their mobility period at FBAUL. This journey references the experiences of the students interviewed during the previous phase.</p>
    <p>The main pain points we identified were related to the programâ€™s bureaucracy, difficulty to navegate the website and other student platforms, and lack of knowledge of the school facilities.</p>

    <h2>Ideation and Solutions</h2>
    <p>How might we easily give access to primary information about the school?<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most menu pages do not have translated content in English;</li>
            <li>Relevant content is difficult to find and is only available in PDF;</li>
            <li>Some pages are not linked and therefore cannot be accessed;</li>
            <li>There is no information in English on the contents of each curricular unit, or on spaces of the faculty;</li>
        </ul>
